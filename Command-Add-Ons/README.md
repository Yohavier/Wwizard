# Wwise Command Add Ons
This is a small collection of Add-Ons, Scripts etc that can help improve your Workflow with Wwise and add functionality and features.
Currently there are following projects that one could try out

1. [Sort Originals](#sortoriginals)

## Sort Originals <a name="sortoriginals"></a>
There are 4 container inside Wwise, that can create a folder in the Originals Path.

- Work Units
- Physical Folders
- Virtual Folders
- Actor-Mixers

One could also use all Wwise Containers, but it would result in very long folder paths with often only one .wav file in it. Like that A folder could indicate a new feature and hence structure the originals accordingly.

To start the process just rightclick somewhere and select "WAAPI->Sort Originals"
