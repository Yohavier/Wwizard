# Wwizard

The GUI is done with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and an extension for a [Node Graph](https://github.com/rokups/ImNodes)

This is a tool, that extends Wwise a bit. Its made to improve your project workflows and keep it tidy. 
In the other two folders I explain a bit about my best practices and ideas about how to improve wwise. 
A more detailed Readme for the application is in the Wwizard folder.

Main features are:
  - assign color coding 
  - Checking naming convention
  - sort originals
  - advanced query editor
  - toolbox with reset faders and remove empty events


## Best Practices
A small gathering of do's and dont's. 

## Naming Convention 
How to name everything in your Wwise Project, so it makes sense, is easy to read and can be used for further automation/processing.
