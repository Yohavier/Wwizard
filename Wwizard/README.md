# Wwise Helpers

## Command Add-Ons
These are python scripts that automate Wwise and add functionality to it. In the folder is a more dedicated README for it. 

## Best Practices
A small gathering of do's and dont's of things I've seen in AAA game dev. 

## Naming Convention 
How to name everything in your Wwise Project, so it makes sense, is easy to read and can be used for further automation/processing. 

## Wwise Extension 
This is still in development and currently needs a lot of cleanup. When its done it is supposed to serve as an extension that helps with queries and gives other utilities.
