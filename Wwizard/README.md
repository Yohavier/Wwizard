# Wwizard

## Modules
### Sort Originals
Determine which Wwise containers can create physical folders and just sort your Originals automatically with one button press. There you can also delete unused wav files, that are still in the directory. 

### Naming Convention
You have various options to create a naming convention.

### Query Editor
With this module you can create and run queries. It lets you create queries either with the waapi code or waql. You also have all the created queries in Wwise at hand that you can run. Lets you run multiple queries together (or logic).

### Color Coding
You can determine which layers create which color. Its also possible to assign them solo or to the whole Hierarchy. There are 2 different weighting, soft and hard. 
Solo Hard > Hierarchy Hard > Solo Soft > Hierarchy Soft. So its possible to override certain colors if needed. 
You can also chose colors that cant be canged under no circumstances.

### Toolbox
Currently that only has two features. 
- Reset the faders in a Hierarchy, you can set containers also to ignore that command with doing a note in Wwise
- Delete invalid/empty events
