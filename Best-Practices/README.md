# Wwise Best Practices

## General 
- Dont overuse the Source Editor. Dont use it as a cutting tool to cut a 10min sfx to 10sec.
- Only push stuff that is finished and not some hard work in progress stuff. Having empty container structures are not useful to anyone.
- Use only one naming Convention. Ive seen wild mixes of namings and its never a good thing and only results in confusion.

## Queries
- use color codes in your project. You can query for colours and thus find stuff that is marked with some meaning way easier.

## Optimization
- if you use a seek table on your conversion settings, 1024/2048 is fine in most cases and doesnt eat up too much memory.
- shift+G opens the "Integrity Report". That one shows you a couple things that you could improve.
